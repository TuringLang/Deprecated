This repo contains depreciated utility packages for Turing.jl. These packages either have been upstreamed to Turing.jl, superseded by new features in Turing.jl itself, or other packages in the Julia ecosystem. 

Planned depreciations: 

- `AdvancedPS.jl`
- `TuringBenchmarking.jl`
- `TuringCallbacks.jl`
- `ParetoSmooth.jl`
